A-Star search code for my Intro to AI course

This is a collection of Python code that demonstrates using search algorithms to solve AI problems. The search algorithms that are implemented are:
* Greedy Search
* Uniform Cost Search
* A-Star Search

There are also two examples of how to use the search techniques to solve problems:
* Farmer-Goat-Wolf-Cabbage
* 8-Puzzle
